	Simple example that controls the blinking of the LED
	connected to digital PIN 13.

	Created by Mike Chambers

	You can hook up an external LED by connecting an LED
	to PIN 13 and GND (make sure that the anode (long leg) is
	connected to PING 13 and the cathode (short leg) is connected
	to GND.

	The on board LED is also connected to PIN 13, and will
	be controlled by this program.

			//However, in general, it is going to be easier, and more flexible
